# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
